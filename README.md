This project is an individual assignment for the "Data Mining" class. 
This project analyzes one of the most popular data sets in Kaggle, 'Heart failure', by performing various data mining techniques covered in the class.

There are two pieces of code in the project folder. One is the work I did for midterm presentation, and the other is the work I did for final presentation.
